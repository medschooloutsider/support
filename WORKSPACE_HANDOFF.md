Updated: 2026-04-29

## Lane

- Branch: `main`
- Responsibility: public support site, private report intake, entitlement checks, moderation, and public grouped issue pages for GPT-MD, PDF-MD, and Alarmist.
- Merge target: `main`
- Master plan: `docs/coordination/MASTER_PLAN.md`

## Current Objective

Prepare deployment and handoff documentation for the first support hub release.

## What Is Already Done

- Fresh Next.js support repo scaffolded.
- Support-specific homepage copy and metadata replaced default Next starter content.
- Package verification scripts are working for lint, test, and build.
- Shared issue/report schema and validation added.
- Initial Supabase database schema migration added.
- Public reviewed issue pages, web report intake, app-originated signed report intake, and owner moderation surfaces are implemented.
- API and deployment handoff docs are in `docs/APP_REPORT_API.md` and `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`.

## Left To Do

- Deploy to `support.medschooloutsider.com`.
- Add app-side Report Issue buttons after the API contract is live.
